Bugs to Fix
- Allow program to send more than one string
- Check for "note:" comments and "Testing..." comments
- Have programmed reply() to only work when there is already a message send to the current process
    - Not sure if this is right but makes it easier for us to code
    - After we have replied, does the target process have to then receive that new message?
- Replying to a process that already holds a message does not work
- Need to make it possible to kill processes in semaphores
- Need to determine if we are allowed to create a semaphore with initial value 0
    - Don't see why not
- Should the same process be able to call a semaphore more than once?
