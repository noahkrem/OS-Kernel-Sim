Bugs to Fix
- kill() when killing current process
    - Output is not great right now
- Semaphores
- Improve output of checkInput()
- Maybe get rid of ready_init()
- Bad things happen when we kill every process except the init process
    - We probably want a statically allocated process that corresponds to the initial process
- We may want to output our errors upon exiting a function, rather than inside the user input function

Possible Questions for Discussion Board
- Do we need to allocate space for our semaphores, or can they be statically allocated?
