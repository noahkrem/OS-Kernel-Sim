Bugs to Fix
- Semaphores
- Allow program to send more than one string
- Check for "note:" comments and "Testing..." comments
- Killing process 0 should not execute
- Sending a message changes the process's own message when it does not go through
- Error with send and reply: The proc_message pointer is pointing to the same memory for each process
- Have programmed reply() to only work when there is already a message send to the current process
    - Not sure if this is right but makes it easier for us to code
    - After we have replied, does the target process have to then receive that new message?
    
- Need to make it possible to kill processes in semaphores
