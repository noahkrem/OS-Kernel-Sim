Bugs to Fix
- Semaphores
- Bad things happen when we kill every process except the init process
    - We probably want a statically allocated process that corresponds to the initial process
- We may want to output our errors upon exiting a function, rather than inside the user input function
- Check requirements for init process on assignment 3 structure document
    - Do we want to be able to print process info for init process
- In totalInfo(), do we want to be able to see the init process
- May want to add a case to send(), where we return -1 if we cannot find the process
- Sending to running process should fail
